# Telegram Bot with yt-dlp Support

This repository contains a Python script that implements a Telegram bot with `yt-dlp` support. The bot allows users to download YouTube videos using the `yt-dlp` command-line utility.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or later
- The `python-telegram-bot` library (see below for installation instructions)
- The `yt-dlp` command-line utility (see the project's website for installation instructions)

To install the `python-telegram-bot` library, you can use the following command:

pip install python-telegram-bot


## Usage

To run the script, you'll need to provide your own `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` as an environment variable. You can do this by running the following command, replacing `<token>` with your own bot token:

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token> python bot.py


Once the script is running, you can use the `/download` command in your Telegram bot to download a YouTube video. For example, you can run the following command to download a video at the specified YouTube URL:

/download <youtube-url>


The bot will use the `yt-dlp` utility to download the video and send a confirmation message to the user when the download is complete.
